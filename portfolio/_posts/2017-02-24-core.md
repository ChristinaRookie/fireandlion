# Changing the way we create, manage, and read books

*The Economy* is an economics textbook leading the way in educational reform, with design that changes the way textbooks are presented. With over 200 contributors collaborating to produce more than 1000 pages of interactive content, it breaks boundaries in terms of what is possible in multiformat publishing. Using our online [Electric Book Manager](insert link to piece on EBM), contributors were able to edit the book directly into version controlled, single-master content files, while simultaneously viewing their edits within the final design context of the book, on a live staging site. 

This method of book production and management has streamlined and revolutionised the publishing process. With access to their single-master file, a client can review, update, and release a new edition of their book at any time. Furthermore, no time-consuming and costly conversions are required as the EBM can output a print book, mobile-friendly website and ebook using the same master file.

The page design of *The Economy* focuses first and foremost on the creation of a beautiful book. It is intentionally designed to look less like a textbook and more like an informative and visually engaging resource. The design was conceptualised on paper and then visualised digitally. Once the design was finalised CSS was written to control its application on paper and screen.

The design is simple and flexible, accommodating multiple in-text and sidebar elements across the pages, while maintaining a strong visual identity throughout the book. It includes graphic details which make the content more engaging and easier to interact with. Colour is used as a visual identifier, enabling readers and teachers to approach the content in a systemised way. Over 1000 economics graphs were designed and executed to illustrate the content, further adding to the production of a highly functional and captivating book.

The website presents more than a second version of the print book. It includes additional features made possible by the digital platform; embedded video, interactive quizzes, animated graph slide-lines, and in-text reference and glossary links. The website is mobile friendly and can be easily and conveniently used as an open educational resource.
