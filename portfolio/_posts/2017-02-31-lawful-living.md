# Making the law readily available and easy to understand

![Lawful Living multi-format]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/lawfulliving_book-cover.jpg)

*Lawful Living* is a multi-format resource of South African law. In its pages, 270 statutes have been explained by Owen Salmon. Presented in plain language and neatly arranged, a reader can find and understand them quickly.

This book project included the design and typesetting of an extensive reference book, as well as making the content, in its entirety, available as a responsive and mobile-friendly website.

We created a bold identity for *Lawful Living* to ensure consistent branding across all media and communication. This included the design of a logo, book cover, stationery, as well as a social media campaign and print advertising.
