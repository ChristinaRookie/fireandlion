# Literature for a multi-format world

![The Park printed book]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/the-park-book-cover.jpg)

A great book cover has three very important jobs that need to be done well. Firstly it needs to be beautiful. A book is judged by its cover and so the cover needs to be visually enticing. Secondly it needs to hint at what is contained within, without giving too much away. Lastly, it needs to capture the essence and tone of the writing, which is an intangible concept and involves the overall 'feel' of the design.

*The Park* is a novel which has undertones of a psychological thriller. The cover design illustrated the main subject of the story, but with a sense of foreboding introduced by the empty swing and acid colours. The book is written in a very personal, narrative style and the handwritten text on the cover pulls this through.

The page design of a book requires a different skill set. It should relate to the cover but needs to be 'invisable' for easy, focused reading. *The Park* uses a classic serif font for the main text. The handwritten text, used on the cover, was introduced for the personal notes in the book. A park-bench icon was designed as a text divider to add visual interest.

Taking this design sensibility into the digital format brings a unique set of challenges. Static page design does not translate simply into the reflowable text on digital devices. The text design is therefore kept flexible in its classic simplicity. Subtle nuances are used to retain the design integrity of the printed book. While fonts are not as easy to control across devices in the digital environment, *The Park* ebook kept the park-bench as the text divider to link the design to the printed book.

Using a single-master workflow, which has one content source file, means that all formats of the book can be produced simultaneosly, with no need for post-production ebook-conversion. [Read more about this workflow here.]({{site.baseurl}}/thinking/2017/05/15/i-love-you-indesign-but/)
