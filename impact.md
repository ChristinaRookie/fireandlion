# Storytelling for impact

**We help impact organisations** grow their stature as change makers and thought leaders, so they can attract committed donors and champions. 

> Your organisation has a rich history. You work on complex issues. Your team has years of experience. Only well-crafted, long-form stories can bottle this for others, and inspire their committment and understanding.

For non-profits and social enterprises, great stories:

* motivate staff, inspire champions, and attract donors;
* spread easily as people share them with others;
* create powerful, consistent messaging for new initiatives;
* focus priorities for smarter, healthier teamwork.

It's not enough to write stories. They must be carefully chosen, packaged, and published. Done right, they change the world by influencing people's thinking and behaviour. We make this happen.

## Long and short stories

Stories take many forms, including books, articles, reports, interviews, presentations, blog posts, video, graphics or any of these in series. Some are long and some are short.

* **Long-form stories underpin strategy.** They convey complex ideas and create deep connections, inspiring meaningful, long-term committments to heroes and principles.
* **Short-form stories are useful as tactics.** They support your strategy by grabbing attention and driving specific calls to action.

We specialise in long-form stories. Well packaged, a long-form story might be a beautiful book, report or keynote talk. And placed in the world, it might be in bookstores, on well-known websites, in key journals, sent to funders, or delivered at conferences. On your own website, long-form stories make for good [inbound marketing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inbound_marketing).

Then we develop short-form stories drawing on those foundations, working with specialists or agencies. Our long-form foundations help create better taglines, elevator pitches, social media campaigns, blog posts, advertising, newsletters, promotional materials, and web designs. We can manage that short-form work for you, or we can plug into your existing agency.

With each project, we develop ways to measure the impact of our stories on your organisation.
