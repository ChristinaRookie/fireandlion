# Making the Constitution truly&nbsp;accessible

![MyConstitution]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/myconstitution_feature.jpg)

Until now, it’s been impossible to read the South African Constitution online in nine of the country’s official languages. This means that African-language speakers across the country, whose only Internet access is on their phones, have not been able to read their own constitution. In partnership with Electric Book Works and the CSIR we created a [public-domain version of the Constitution](http://myconstitution.co.za) in all eleven official South African languages, optimised for mobile phones and cheap printing.

Using the CSIR’s ground-breaking text-to-speech technology we’re making it possible for illiterate and visually impaired South Africans to listen to their Constitution, too.
