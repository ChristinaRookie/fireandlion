# Crafted typography

Every book carries its own brand in its design. We create crafted typography for beautiful and memorable book designs. This creative process begins on paper, by-hand, like this one for *Race Otherwise*, published by Wits University Press.

The structure and concept, planned on paper, forms the rough composition for the final typography, which is executed using digital tools. The pencil sketch is traced and converted into a vector format, which can then be incorporated into the design.
