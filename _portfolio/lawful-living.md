# Making the law readily available and easy to understand

![Lawful Living multi-format]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/lawfulliving-feature.jpg)

*Lawful Living* is a multi-format reference book of South African law, as is applies to everyday life and business. Working with a team over several years, the author, Owen Salmon, has explained over 270 statutes in plain language. Our job was to arrange and design this large publication for paper and screen, so that readers can find what they need quickly and easily, whether they're reading the book or visiting the website.

This book project included page design and typesetting as well as making the content, in its entirety, available as a responsive and mobile-friendly website.

We also created a bold identity for the *Lawful Living* brand, ensuring consistency across all media and communications. This included the design of a logo, book cover, stationery, a social media campaign, and print advertising.

*Lawful Living* is now available as a series of smaller books which provide subject specific excerpts from the main book. Using our single-master workflow it was possible to output this child-series from the original book's master, without needing to create multiple versions containing repeat content. This system ensures that the book production is efficient, accurate and cost effective.

The visual identity was successfully extended across the series, maintaining the strong design and branding of the original publication.
