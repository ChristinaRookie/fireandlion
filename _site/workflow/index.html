<h1 class="no_toc" id="how-we-manage-our-work">How we manage our work</h1>

<p><strong>If you’re going to choose us,</strong> you want to be sure you’re working with the best. As we earn your trust, we’ll be aiming to prove we’re:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>A one-stop shop</em>, providing fully integrated print and digital production.</li>
  <li><em>A pleasure to work with</em>, being a small team of local, experienced and friendly pros.</li>
  <li><em>Organised</em>, using clear, sensible systems for version-control, storage and archiving.</li>
  <li><em>Transparent</em>, so you can ask us anything, track projects and access files online, any time.</li>
  <li><em>Future-proof</em>, focusing on open standards that prevent lock-in and give you the flexibility to use your content in new ways.</li>
</ul>

<p>We do that in large part by being very organised. Here is how we work. If you’re a new Fire and Lion client, we recommend that you give this a quick read. (You may also want to look over <a href="/terms">our standard terms</a>.)</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>First of all, our systems are mostly for us. They let us spend more time on your projects and less time doing admin. We don’t require that our clients use them, too – we’re happy to stick to email if you like. But you may find that our systems integrate well with yours, and make your job easier.</p>

<p>In short: your project lives online and you can track it there if you choose to. These are our key tools for managing your work:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Function</th>
      <th>Online tool</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Project management</td>
      <td><a href="http://trello.com">Trello</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>File delivery</td>
      <td><a href="http://dropbox.com">Dropbox</a></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Digital-first content</td>
      <td><a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>These tools work nicely with our content-production workflows. We use two workflows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A traditional InDesign-based workflow.</li>
  <li>A cutting-edge digital-first workflow.</li>
</ol>

<p>And we choose the best one for the job at hand. Our clients are generally familiar with the traditional InDesign workflow. It’s excellent for design-heavy content like coffee-table books. We cover our digital-first workflow below.</p>

<h2 id="project-management-with-trello">Project management with Trello</h2>

<p><a href="http://trello">Trello</a> is a free, simple and powerful tool for managing any kind of project. On Trello, you create boards (think ‘notice board’), which are divided into lists (think ‘columns’). Each list contains cards (think ‘stickies’). A card can contain any amount of detail, including a general description, checklists, conversations and attachments.</p>

<p>For every client, we create a Trello board. On that board, we create four lists: Admin, Planned Projects, Current Projects, and Complete Projects. Each project gets a card. Everything that happens on a project goes on its card, especially important correspondence. The card is where we keep track of a project’s journey.</p>

<p>If you use Trello, send us your username. We’ll invite you to join your Fire and Lion board. There you can check up on us or even participate in our conversations. Your board can replace emailing us, and provides a far better archive of project-specific correspondence than email.</p>

<p>We have a very specific and strict system for using Trello cards. In summary:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Key stages and tasks within a project must be listed in card checklists.</li>
  <li>If a project task needs doing, the card must have a due date, and be assigned to the person responsible for getting the task done.</li>
  <li>Only one person should be assigned to a card at a time.</li>
</ul>

<p>This way, anyone can see their tasks in one place easily by going to <a href="https://trello.com/me/cards">trello.com/me/cards</a>.</p>

<h2 id="file-delivery-with-dropbox">File delivery with Dropbox</h2>

<p>We use <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/business">Dropbox for Business</a> to store and back up all our files. (We also keep a local backup of everything.) We create a special folder for each client for delivering their files, and give you a secret link to that folder online.</p>

<p>This gives you free, unlimited access to your files at any time from anywhere. (Remember when you had to ask your freelance designers to find a backup CD of your work in their office cupboards? Never again.)</p>

<p>But please keep your link secret! If you ever think someone has that link who shouldn’t, let us know and we’ll send you a new secret link.</p>

<p>You don’t need a Dropbox account to get your files. That said, if you do have a Dropbox account, Dropbox lets you easily copy the files we send you to your own Dropbox account, without even having to download and re-upload them yourself.</p>

<h2 id="digital-content-on-github">Digital content on GitHub</h2>

<p>Much of our work involves digitising content and building code to process it. We call this our master ‘source’, including source content and source code. We use best-practice version control (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)">Git</a>) and online storage for this.</p>

<p>For any digital-first content or code, we track and store everything in <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> repositories. (We also sometimes use other services like <a href="http://bitbucket.org">BitBucket</a> and <a href="http://gitlab.com">GitLab</a> if the project calls for it, or the client has an existing repo we need to work in.)</p>

<p>If you’d like to see or access your source files, let us know your GitHub username and we’ll give you access to your repository.</p>

<h2 id="digital-first-story-production">Digital-first story production</h2>

<p>Like many innovative publishers, we use a single-master, digital-first workflow for producing books. This system lets us store your content once, and from that to quickly produce separate editions for print, ebooks and websites.</p>

<p>The stages in this workflow are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>We convert the manuscript to markdown.</strong> This is part automated, part manual. Usually we handle this conversion working from manuscripts in MS Word. However, we highly recommend that the book editor creates the final manuscript in markdown to save costs.</li>
  <li><strong>We create a page design.</strong> Unlike traditional InDesign process, we can create the page design (‘look and feel’) working with the entire book, not just a sample. This means we can account for every feature in a book – no surprises caused by incomplete design specs. Also, if you are happy to use our standard design template, there is no charge at all for page design.</li>
  <li><strong>We deliver PDF page proofs for proofreading.</strong> If we receive the manuscript in markdown and you use our standard page design, we can send you proofs in a matter of hours. (We’ll happily train your editors in markdown for free. See <a href="http://electricbookworks.github.io/electric-book-workflow/guide/03-markdown.html#markdown">our training notes here</a>.)</li>
  <li><strong>We implement the proofreader’s corrections.</strong> Even better: your editor can log into our system online and make the changes themselves, saving time and costs.</li>
  <li><strong>We refine typography.</strong> Once the text is final, our designers work through the print layout to solve widows, orphans and bad linebreaks.</li>
  <li><strong>We send you final, print-ready PDFs.</strong> They are also available to you online to download any time, using a secret link we provide.</li>
</ol>

<p>This means that for most books, we don’t use InDesign at all for typesetting interior pages. And if editors give us content in markdown, we can produce page proofs in a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>Our system was developed by our team, based on industry best practice, and specifically to be able to produce publications of the kind and quality expected from high-end publishing companies.</p>

<p>The system uses only open formats (like markdown, HTML and CSS) and is open-source. This means you never again have to worry that your content will be trapped in proprietary formats that go out of date or keep you beholden to pricey software.</p>

<p>In technical terms, we use static-site generation to produce HTML from markdown, and CSS (preprocessed from Sass) to design for various output formats. You can <a href="http://electricbookworks.github.io/electric-book-workflow/">read about the workflow in lots of detail here</a>.</p>

<p>In non-technical terms, you get beautiful books faster, cheaper, and future-proof. You spend less money and time on typesetting, and more on good editing.</p>
