# Online book hosting and support

When we produce your book with our Electric Book workflow, you can have online access to your project's source files and their version-controlled history. You can even make your own changes to the text and output your book in PDF and as a website.

When you take a monthly support plan:

- We cover the cost of your access to all your books' private repositories on GitHub (where they're managed by us).
- You can use Fire and Lionâ€™s beta Electric Book Manager to output and even edit your book collaboratively.
- Our friendly, experienced team will provide email and video-call support to help you use GitHub and the Electric Book Manager.

One subscription gives you access to unlimited books in unlimited repositories managed by Fire and Lion. Subscriptions are priced per user.

## Pricing

Your support needs will vary depending on whether a book is in development (e.g. on your frontlist) or largely complete (on your backlist). We offer tiers for each of these situations.
