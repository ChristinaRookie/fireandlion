# Making children's books with Book Dash

[Book Dash](http://bookdash.org) publishes a range of children’s books in many languages. We worked with [Worldreader](http://www.worldreader.org/) to turn these into reusable HTML and ebooks that could be read on any device. Our workflow and technology had to be rock solid and future-proof, to ensure that partners who reuse the material can rely on it always working. [See the project in action here](http://bookdash.github.io/bookdash-books/).

Book Dash has also relied on our smart team and sensible systems to manage the creation of over a hundred translations of Book Dash books into various languages.
