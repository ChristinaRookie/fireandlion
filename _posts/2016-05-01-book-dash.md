# Making children's books with Book Dash

Book Dash publishes a range of children’s books in many languages, and worked with Worldreader and Fire and Lion to turn these into HTML and ebooks that could be read on any device. Our workflow and technology had to be rock solid and future-proof, to ensure that partners who reuse the material can rely on it always working. If you’re technically inclined, see the project in action [on GitHub](https://github.com/bookdash/bookdash-books).

Book Dash has also relied on our smart team and sensible systems to manage the creation of over a hundred translations of Book Dash books into various languages.
