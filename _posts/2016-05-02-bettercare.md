# Multi-format, open-access healthcare

Non-profit healthcare publisher [Bettercare](http://bettercare.co.za) relies on Fire and Lion to develop and maintain its library of  open-access textbooks as books, ebooks and a website.

Since healthcare information changes often and can be life-saving, Bettercare books need to be stored and edited in single master files, with strict version control and maximum up-time. In a competitive healthcare-publishing marketplace, they also need to look great and be easy for busy, non-technical nurses and midwives to learn from.

We make this possible with our [Electric Book workflow](http://electricbook.works), which lets us produce books in multiple formats from one source, all managed with best-practice version control.
