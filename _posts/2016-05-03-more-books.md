# Shaping public opinion for More Books

The [More Books Campaign](http://morebooks.co.za), supported by the Publisher’s Association of South Africa, was an advocacy initiative aimed at influencing public opinion on textbook regulations. The issues involved were complex and the strategy highly nuanced. In this campaign, we had to boil down complex messages to a series of powerful images for a Facebook campaign, which was carefully aligned and timed with behind-the-scenes lobbying. The campaign’s popularity – measured by petition signatures and engagement with the campaign images – far exceeded our expectations.
