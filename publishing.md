# For book publishers

**We free publishers** to focus on what matters most to them. We manage print and digital book production, promotional material and content preservation.

> What do you want to spend more time on? Many publishers want to develop authors and run
special projects. Do you spend a lot of time project-managing freelancers, generating marketing materials, and
chasing after project files? If you outsourced this to a great team, would you have more time to focus on what
matters most to you?

[Our team]({{site.baseurl}}/team) combines world-class design and digital expertise, built on a deep understanding of book publishing.

## Production

We manage all your frontlist and backlist production from manuscript to finished files in multiple formats. Use [our easy Google Sheets calculator](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UryqTYbQLNvFPcYEK3ifSjS_E9opJgvnFyOeu2IMsiU/edit?usp=sharing) for an instant cost estimate. And see [our simple terms here]({{site.baseurl}}/terms).

At the same time, we'll produce all your default promotional material – such as info sheets, social media posts, press collateral and catalogues – and collate each book's basic metadata.

## Ongoing production committment

If you're ready to place five or more books with us per year, we can offer extra value:

* Online project tracking: check and chat about your projects' status online at any time.
* Online file access and preservation: download finished files as and when you need them.
* Basic metadata management: we collate and manage basic metadata for all books you place with us. Access and download this metadata online at any time.
* A discount: if you commit to a minimum number of books per year, you get a discount from your very first book. We take 5&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent off for every five books committed, up to 20&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent. (If after 12 months you haven't placed as many books with us as you planned, we simply invoice for the value of the discount, so you just pay the normal price.)

While you have an ongoing-production agreement with us, we’ll store and manage your files for free, keeping
them easily accessible to you online at all times. When your ongoing commitment of books ends, you can either
download and store your own files, or leave it to us for a nominal monthly book-hosting fee.

## Service committment

If you’re going to put all your eggs in our basket, you need to be sure you’re working with the best. As we earn your trust, we'll be aiming to prove we're:

* **A one-stop shop**: fully integrated print and digital production.
* **A pleasure to work with**: a small team of local, experienced and friendly pros.
* **Organised**: clear, sensible systems for version-control, storage and archiving.
* **Transparent**: ask us anything, track project progress and access your files online, any time.
* **Future proof**: our focus on open standards and open software mean less vendor lock in and greater flexibility to quickly repurpose your content for new platforms and experiments.
