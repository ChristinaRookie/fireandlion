# The art of storytelling and&nbsp;design

**At Fire and Lion** we craft long-form stories that immerse and inspire. We&nbsp;help impact organisations grow their stature as change makers and thought leaders, so they can attract more committed donors and champions. And we help publishers manage their book-making, lowering their costs and freeing their time to focus on authors and special projects.
